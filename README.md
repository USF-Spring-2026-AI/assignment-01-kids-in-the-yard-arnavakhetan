## AI Assignment 01 - Kids in the Yard

# Comparison
1. Which tool(s) did you use?
   I used an LLM (Specifically ChatGPT Model 5.2) for comparison with my implementation.
   
2. If you used an LLM, what was your prompt to the LLM?
   I gave it screenshots of the Assignment PDF (the parts about the implementation itself and what the code should do, the example provided of how the code should run, and the sample design given). I gave screenshots because I think a good prompt for an LLM should have both images and text (atleast what to code itself can be better explained through the the pdf). I followed up by sending it all of the csv files (except the one for CS 562) and asked it to consider these in the code. My prompt itself was: "This is a Python program that you have to code. Read through these screenshots of what the code should contain, an example screenshot of how it should run and the potential inputs and outputs and make sure all of the code follows the coding style of PEP8 as shown in the last image. I have also attached all of the csv files that will be used for this."
